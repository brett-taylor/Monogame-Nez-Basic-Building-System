Task should consist of subtasks and subtasks consists of actions

Tasks will have a queue of Subtasks
Subtasks will have a queue of actions
When a task is top of the WORLD_TASKS queue,
the subtask top of the TASK_SUBTASK queue is chosen,
the qction top of the TASK_SUB_TASK_ACTIONS queue is chosen and delegated to a worker
The worker then completes the action.

This allow us to have a building as a task, and then subtasks to tell workers to (EG) remove,
all buildings or tasks currently in the area. Then to (EG) move all resources needed for the building,
to the task position. And then finally (EG) build the actual building.

	Sub task
		- Remove tree

	Sub task:
		- Build flooring
		- Build flooring
		- Build flooring
		- Build flooring
		- Build wall
		- Build wall
		- Build wall
		- Build wall
Task will now be done

Task
{
	QUEUE of type subtasks: subtasks
	SUBTASK getTopSubtask();

SubTask
{
	QUEUE of type actions: actions
	ACTION getTopAction();
}

ACTION
{
	action onComplete;
